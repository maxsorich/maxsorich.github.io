</div>
<p>Socrates was born circa 470 BC, in Athens, Greece. We know of his life
through the writings of his students, including Plato and Xenophon. His 
"Socratic method," laid the groundwork for Western systems of logic and 
philosophy. When the political climate of Greece turned, Socrates was sentenced 
to death by hemlock poisoning in 399 BC. He accepted this judgment rather than
fleeing into exile.</p>
